## Time Evolution and Quantum System Dynamics: Monte Carlo Solver with QuTip
Rather than a experimental practice, this project is solely based on theoretical arguments.` Monte Carlo` simulations are frequently used in quantum mechanics to investigate the dynamics of quantum systems with numerical approach, particularly in situations when obtaining precise analytical answers is challenging or impossible. `QuTiP` (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a robust Python package which is used to simulate open quantum systems. It offers a range of functions for Monte Carlo simulations of quantum dynamics.

## "A two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity"
A two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity usually refers to a system in which an energy-leveled atom interacts with an electromagnetic field contained in a cavity that permits energy leakage. This situation is frequently examined within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which examines the interaction between photons and atoms in cavities.

- The atom is basically described by a two-level quantum system.
- It has a ground state, let's say $\left| g \right\rangle$ and an excited state $\left| e \right\rangle$.
- While photons can be contained within the cavity, energy can also escape from it.
