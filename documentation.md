## Time Evolution and Quantum System Dynamics: Monte Carlo Solver with QuTip
### "A two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity"

Rather than a experimental practice, this project is solely based on theoretical arguments.` Monte Carlo` simulations are frequently used in quantum mechanics to investigate the dynamics of quantum systems with numerical approach, particularly in situations when obtaining precise analytical answers is challenging or impossible. `QuTiP` (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a robust Python package which used to simulate open quantum systems. It offers a range of functions for Monte Carlo simulations of quantum dynamics.

### NOTE: 
I am keeping references as they are, I will cite properly on the later time. This is just for keeping them safe here, will follow citation formats later on.
