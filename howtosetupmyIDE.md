## Development Environment Setup:
The goal of this computational project is to simulate and evaluate complex systems using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, generating probabilistic predictions and evaluating uncertainty.

**1. Create a GitHub Repository:**
 A github repository named `MC-CP2P2024` has been created in the UBSUNY GitHub.

**2.Enable GitHub Codespaces:**
By Cclicking on the "Code" button and selecting "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown menu, a codespace is generated.

**3. Add the devcontainer.json file:**
A `devcontainer` folder is created in the codespace and `devcontainer.json` file is added that has necessary tools for computaional project based on **Monte Cralo Simulation**.

**4. Milestones:**
Multiple milestones has been generated to make the project well-structured and tracked.
