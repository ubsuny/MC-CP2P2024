## Time Evolution and Quantum System Dynamics: Monte Carlo Solver with QuTip
Rather than a experimental practice, this project is solely based on theoretical arguments.` Monte Carlo` simulations are frequently used in quantum mechanics to investigate the dynamics of quantum systems with numerical approach, particularly in situations when obtaining precise analytical answers is challenging or impossible. `QuTiP` (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a robust Python package which is used to simulate open quantum systems. It offers a range of functions for Monte Carlo simulations of quantum dynamics.

## "A two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity"
A two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity usually refers to a system in which an energy-leveled atom interacts with an electromagnetic field contained in a cavity that permits energy leakage. This situation is frequently examined within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which examines the interaction between photons and atoms in cavities.

- The atom is basically described by a two-level quantum system.
- It has a ground state, let's say $\left| g \right\rangle$ and an excited state $\left| e \right\rangle$.
- While photons can be contained within the cavity, energy can also escape from it.

### Description:
Generally, Atoms have discrete energy levels, and a two-level atom refers to an atom with two relevant energy states: a ground state $\left| g \right\rangle$ and an excited state $\left| e \right\rangle$. Photons, usually in the optical or microwave frequency range, can be absorbed or emitted to trigger the transition between these two states[^1]. The system can absorb energy and change from the ground state to the "excited" state if the energy levels are not degenerate, or have unequal energies. An atom will periodically absorb photons from a coherent beam of light and reemit them through stimulated emission. A Rabi cycle is one such cycle, and the system's Rabi frequency is the inverse of its duration[^2]. The probability of finding the atom in the excited state is found from the Bloch equations to be:
 
 $(|c_{b}(t)|^{2} = \sin^{2}(\frac{\omega t}{2}))$,

 where ${\displaystyle \omega }$ is the Rabi frequency.

A cavity, is a confined space between two mirrors that can trap electromagnetic fields, such as photons, within it. These modes are quantized, meaning they can only have certain discrete frequencies and energies. A two-level atom's charge distribution inside its structure gives it an electric dipole moment.  The two-level atom interacts with the cavity mode via its electric dipole moment. There is a photon-based electromagnetic field inside the cavity. Because of the mirrors at either end, these photons are contained within the cavity and are able to oscillate. The atom gains energy and changes to its excited state as it receives a photon from the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, the atom loses energy and returns to its ground state when it emits a photon. Photons from the electromagnetic field are either absorbed or emitted by the atom as it moves between its excited and ground states. **The energies of the cavity mode (photons), atoms and the interactions, all are governed by the Hamiltonian describing the system.**
The Hamiltonian that describes the full system,

$({\hat {H}}={\hat {H}}_{\text{field}}+{\hat {H}}_{\text{atom}}+{\hat {H}}_{\text{int}})$

consists of the cavity field Hamiltonian, the atomic excitation Hamiltonian, and the Jaynesâ€“Cummings interaction Hamiltonian respectively[^3].


A cavity that is not completely sealed off from its surroundings is referred to as a **leaky cavity**. It causes dissipation and energy loss by allowing photons to leave the cavity. There are a number of ways that photons can leak into the surrounding area, including connection to external waveguides or faulty mirrors.






### Applications:
The two-level atom coupled to a leaky cavity is a model system widely used in quantum information processing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. It serves as a platform for implementing basic quantum operations, such as qubit initialization, gates, and measurement, as well as more advanced protocols like quantum error correction and quantum state transfer.
